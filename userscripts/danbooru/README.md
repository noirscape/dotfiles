This folder contains my userscripts for doing things on a danbooru instance.

They are *mostly* aimed at making copying tag and wiki data from an "upstream" danbooru instance (in this specific case, the official danbooru servers) to a personal one easier.

You can install `donmai.js` straight from the browser, while `own-server.js` needs to be modified before you can use it (you'll have to point it to your own domain.)

`common.js` contains some common functionality that both scripts need.
